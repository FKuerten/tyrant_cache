This is TyrantCache, a cli wrapper for the library tyrant-cache.

This cli wrapper provides access to the library tyrant-cache, in addition we use a primitve pstream based interface to TyrantOptimize (not by me).

The cli interface is different from TyrantOptimize's (I would say: better), but the main feature is to cache results of the simulation.
This is of course only of limited use for manual users, however the library tyrant-cache is intended to be used in optimizers.
